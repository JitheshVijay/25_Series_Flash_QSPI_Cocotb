# 25 Series Flash QSPI Cocotb
The Series 25 flash memory devices typically use the Quad Serial Peripheral Interface (QSPI) for communication. QSPI is an extension of the SPI protocol and allows for data to be transferred four bits at a time, enabling faster read and write speeds compared to standard SPI.

# API for QSPI Flash IP
Created a Python class that acts as an API for interacting with the QSPI flash memory module. This class will provide methods for basic operations like reading, writing, and erasing data from the flash memory.

# Test Cases for Verification
Wrote test cases to verify the functionality of the QSPI flash memory module using the API we defined.
